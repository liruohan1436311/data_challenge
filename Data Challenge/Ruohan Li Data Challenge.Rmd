## Task 1 Property Lease-Up Summary

```{r loaddata}
library(openxlsx)
msa1 = read.xlsx("./raw_data/leaseup/MSA1.xlsx", sheet = 4, startRow = 5)
msa2 = read.xlsx("./raw_data/leaseup/MSA2.xlsx", sheet = 4, startRow = 4)

```
### 1. How many properties are delivered since April 2008 of these two markets?

### 2. What is the average lease-up time for these two markets?

### 3. Is there any interesting findings you would like to share with us?

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
